\section{Harmonizer}
The harmonizer is responsible for finding the ``best'' harmonization for a given melody with the help of a given harmonic style as defined above. It is defined in the Harmonization class and treats all possible sequences of chord progressions and their weights as a shortest path graph problem. Therefore it makes use of the NetworkX library (https://networkx.github.io), a popular python library providing classes and algorithms for working with networks and graphs.
